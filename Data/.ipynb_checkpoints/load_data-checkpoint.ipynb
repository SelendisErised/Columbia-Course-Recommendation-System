The historical development, both the general context and the particular events concerning communications, is presented chronologically.  The social needs that elicited new technologies and the consequences of their adoption are examined.  Throughout the course, relevant scientific and engineering principles are explained as needed.  These include, among others the concept and effective use of spectrum, multiplexing to improve capacity, digital coding and networking principles.  There are no prerequistes, and no prior scientific or engineering knowledge is required.  Engineering students may not count this course as a technical elective.\n",
